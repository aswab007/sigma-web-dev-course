# 🚀 Sigma Web Dev Course — My Developer Journey

Welcome to my personal repository for the **Sigma Web Development Course** by CodeWithHarry.
From **zero** to **front-end hero** — this repo is my living log of every HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concept I’ve practiced, every project I’ve built, and every bug I’ve wrestled with (and hopefully fixed 😅).

> 👨‍💻 Built by: [aswab007](https://github.com/aswab007)
> 🎯 Goal: Become a **front-end expert** through **code-first learning**

This journey isn’t just about writing code. It’s about **thinking like a developer**, breaking down problems, building small things first, then bigger things, and keeping the momentum alive every single day. Every file in this repo is a lesson learned, an experiment, and a reminder that progress compounds.

## 🌱 How I Built This — My Learning Philosophy

I followed a simple loop every day:

1. Pick one topic (theory or a short video clip).
2. Try a small demo.
3. Break it, then fix it.
4. Build a tiny project that uses that concept.
5. Commit and push.

This approach keeps learning *active* instead of passive. If you’re learning too, try this: pick a single concept, build something tiny with it, and commit — it compounds faster than you think.

## 💡 Notable Mini-Projects & Exercises

* **Business Name Generator (35th / Exercise10)** — practice with strings, randomness, and UI updates.
* **Random Color Boxes (40th / Exercise12)** — DOM creation + styling + randomness.
* **Factorial Calculator (37th / Exercise11)** — simple algorithm practice, input validation.
* **Dynamic Website Builder (42nd / Exercise13)** — practice creating/removing elements, building UI dynamically.

Each of these exercises is intentionally small so you can copy, adapt, and extend them into your own projects quickly.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aswab007/sigma-web-dev-course.git
   ```
2. Open the folder for any lesson and run the `index.html` (or respective file) in your browser.
3. Read my notes in the folder and experiment — change values, add features, break things, fix them. That’s how you learn.

---

## 🌟 Tips for Anyone Following This Repo

* Start with `1st` folder and slowly move forward — concepts build on each other.
* Try to *rebuild* each exercise on your own without looking at the solution first.
* Add a small change to every project — a color tweak or an input validation — to make it yours.
* Keep a separate branch for experiments. Don’t fear messy commits; they show progress.

## 🏁 The End? Nope — Just the Beginning

This repo is **proof** that steady practice beats rare bursts of speed.
It’s my portfolio of progress — a launchpad for bigger projects and better ideas. Fork it, remix it, and most importantly — build something with it.

If you’re reading this and thinking, “I want to learn too” — start now. Build one tiny thing today. Tomorrow, build another.

**Keep coding. Keep shipping. Keep improving.** 🔥

Do you want me to now make this README **more concise and clean for GitHub** while keeping all the info? That way it’s easier to scan.
